If the user tries to login with an email that is not registered, they will not be able to login, however, they also 
will not be notified that their email has not been registered.
If the user tries to sign up with an email that is already registered, they will not be able to sign up, however they 
also will not be notified that their email has already been registered.
  -Both of the above are in Register.js, and would require proper error handling to be added as well as some mechanism for visual feedback.

When the side navbar is open, the table is able to be clicked through the navbar 
  -A quick fix would be to make the navbar opaque rather than transparent, but this would make it so that part of the table is unable to be seen while
  the navbar is toggled on. 
  When we tried to move the table over to the right, we were having problems with whitespace appearing on the right.
  
When trying to click on a goal for more information about the goal, only the bottom half of the category section of the goal can be clicked on
  -This is because we're using a tagpicker component from an external library and the component doesn't have the same onClick function. Looking 
  more closely at how the tagpicker component works might help create a solution.
  
When trying to click on the Priority or Category items in the navbar, only the text can be clicked as opposed to the entire row.
  -This is in the SideBarNav.js file and trying to change the div styling might help make them clickable everywhere.
